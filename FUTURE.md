### Possible future features
This is a non-exaustive list of features that could be implemented in either the language or the reference interpreter in the future:

 - Interpreter flags in comments
 - Shorthand "string mode" and function call/definition shorthand
 - Tail call optimization
 - Temporarily ignore "trigger can't trigger itself" restriction 
 - Debugger
 - More builtin keywords
   - sign, denominator, version
